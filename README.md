# Robotic Arm/Manipulator for Pick-and-Place Tasks  

This project simulates a robotic arm performing a pick-and-place task as part of an automated manufacturing process. Using **RoboDK** and **MATLAB Robotics Toolbox**, the project involves trajectory planning, forward and inverse kinematics, and velocity profiling to evaluate the performance of the robotic arm.

## Overview  

The task automates picking a disk from **Station 1**, moving it to **Station 2** for labeling, and finally transferring it to **Station 3** before sending it to a conveyor. The system simulates real-world manufacturing scenarios using advanced robotic tools.

### Key Parameters:  
- **Disk Dimensions**: Diameter 2 cm, Weight 0.5 kg.  
- **Stations**: Defined work cell dimensions for the robotic arm.  
- **Robotic Arm**: Selected based on degrees of freedom (DOF), payload, and workspace reach.  

## Features  

- **Simulation**: Robotic arm modeled and tested in RoboDK.  
- **Trajectory Planning**: Implemented using MATLAB, including waypoints for path optimization.  
- **Kinematics**: Forward and inverse kinematics analyzed for joint and end-effector positions.  
- **Velocity Profiling**: Generated velocity profiles for joints and the end effector to optimize movement.  

## Tools and Software  

- **RoboDK**: Simulates robotic arm movements.  
- **MATLAB Robotics Toolbox**: Provides tools for kinematic and trajectory planning.  

## Workflow  

1. **Robotic Arm Selection**:  
   - Chosen from the RoboDK library considering workspace, DOF, and payload requirements.  

2. **Simulation in RoboDK**:  
   - Disk picked from Station 1.  
   - Placed in Station 2 for labeling.  
   - Moved to Station 3 and transferred to a conveyor.  

3. **Trajectory Planning in MATLAB**:  
   - Defined waypoints for start (pick), end (place), and intermediate positions.  
   - Simulated paths and generated velocity profiles.  

4. **Kinematic Analysis**:  
   - Forward kinematics validated the position of the end effector.  
   - Inverse kinematics ensured joint configurations matched the planned path.  

## Challenges  

- Ensuring accuracy in trajectory planning and kinematic calculations.  
- Selecting a robotic arm that meets payload and workspace constraints.  
- Debugging simulation errors in RoboDK and MATLAB.  

## Future Improvements  

- Enhance trajectory planning with collision detection.  
- Introduce dynamic path optimization for real-time operations.  
- Expand to multi-arm robotic systems for parallel task execution.
